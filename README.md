# Project 1: Rainy Day

For CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

Created a web page to query weather information.
Users may register to the website and log in using their credentials.
Once logged in, users may be able to search for cities and towns in the US and see recent weather data.
Users may also query for basic information about the location via the website's API.

Python and Flask are used as the server to direct the pages and the API.
A third-party API by Dark Sky is used to get current weather data.
